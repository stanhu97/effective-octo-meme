The character is a cs major student who sucks at debugging. He is tortured by this p2 program and he is confused.

However, through hard work and dedication, he finished that p2 program, and passed with flying colors! His great success on this gave him the confidence to take a trip.

However, due to current circumstances, a trip seemed like a bad idea, so instead he settled for a government suggested self-quarentine. This wasn't too bad however since somehow their is homework to do over spring break.

There are still a lot of homework to do for cs 400 after the spring break. However all face-to-face lecture are cancelled, we could do all the homework in home!
